The Mantis Publish library (known internally to Netflix as Mantis Realtime Events, or MRE) allows your application to stream events into Mantis.
The library supports JVM and Node.js applications.

Mantis Publish takes care of filtering the events you send into Mantis, and it will only transmit them over the
network if a Mantis client that is interested in such events is currently subscribed.

Mantis Publish contains a subscription registry where each client subscription is represented by its
corresponding [Mantis Query Language] (MQL) query. Mantis Publish evaluates all MQL queries from its
subscription registry against each event as the event is generated by your application. It then tags
events with all of the matching MQL queries and enriches the event with a superset of fields from
the matched queries. That is, rather than emitting *n* events for *n* matching MQL queries, Mantis Publish will
instead emit a single event containing all of the fields requested by the matched queries. This
happens directly within your application before any events are sent over the network into Mantis.
Further, Mantis Publish only dispatches events if a client is subscribed with a matching query. This means that
you can freely produce events without incurring the cost until an active subscription exists.

## How to Add the Mantis Publish Library

To add this library to your application, include [mantis-publish-netty](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:mantis-publish-netty)
in your application’s dependencies.

## How to Stream Events Into Mantis

If your application wants to stream events into Mantis, you can use the Mantis Publish library directly by
instantiating a `MantisEventPublisher` in your application code. In order to create a `MantisEventPublisher`,
you will have to inject a few parameters. An example of which parameters are required and how to inject them
can be found in [here](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-publish/blob/master/mantis-publish-netty/src/test/java/io/mantisrx/publish/netty/LocalMrePublishClientInitializer.java).

Once injected, either manually via constructor or an injection framework such as Guice or Spring,
you must use the `MrePublishClientInitializer` class and call `MrePublishClientInitializer#start` to start all
the underlying components. From there, you can get an event publisher by calling `MrePublishClientInitializer#getEventPublisher`.
An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-publish/blob/master/mantis-publish-netty/src/test/java/io/mantisrx/publish/netty/LocalMrePublishClientInitializer.java#L123-L133).

Then, for each event your application generates, create a `Event` object with your desired event fields,
and pass that `Event` to the `MantisEventPublisher#publish` method. For example:

```java hl_lines="9 18"
// Create an `Event` for Mantis Publish using your application event.
final Event event = new Event();
event.set("testKey", "testValue");

// Send your `Event` into Mantis.
// Note: This event will only be dispatched over the network
// if a subscription with a matching MQL query exists.
eventPublisher.publish(event);
```

## The Runtime Flow of Mantis Publish

Mantis Publish runtime flow consists of three phases: connecting, event processing, and event delivery.

### Phase 1: Connecting

Mantis Publish will only stream an event from your application into Mantis if there is a subscriber to that
specific application instance with an MQL query that matches the event. Any [Mantis Job] can connect
to these applications. However, it is a best practice to have [Source Jobs] connect to Mantis Publish
applications. This is because Source Jobs provide several conveniences over regular Mantis Jobs,
such as multiplexing events and connection management. By leveraging Source Jobs as an intermediary,
Mantis Jobs are able to consume events from an external source without having to worry about
lower-level details of that external source.

This is possible through job chaining, which Mantis provides by default. When connecting to a
Mantis Publish application, downstream Mantis Jobs will send subscription requests with an MQL query via HTTP to a Source
Job. The Source Job will store these subscriptions in memory. These subscriptions are then fetched by upstream
applications at the edge running the Mantis Publish library. Once the upstream edge Mantis Publish application
is aware of the subscription, it will start pushing events downstream into the Source Job.

!!! note
    The Mantis Publish library not only handles subscriptions, but also takes care of discovering Source Job workers
    so you do not have to worry about Source Job rebalancing/autoscaling.
    For more information about Source Jobs see
    [Mantis Internals: Mantis Source Jobs](/internals/sourcejobs).

#### Creating Stream Subscriptions

Clients such as Mantis Jobs connect to a Mantis Publish application by submitting a subscription represented
by an HTTP request. Mantis Publish’s `StreamManager` maintains these subscriptions in-memory. The
`StreamManager` manages internal resources such as subscriptions, streams, and internal processing
queues.

Clients can create subscriptions to different event streams. There are two types:

1. **`default` streams** contain events emitted by applications that use the Mantis Publish library.
1. **`log` streams** contain events which may not be core to the application, such as log or general infrastructure events.

### Phase 2: Event Processing

Event processing within Mantis Publish takes place in two steps: event ingestion and event dispatch.

#### Event Ingestion

Event ingestion begins at the edge, in your application, by invoking `EventPublisher#publish` which places the
event onto an internal queue for dispatching.

#### Event Dispatch

Events are dispatched by a drainer thread created by the Event Publisher. The drainer will drain events
from the internal queue previously populated by `EventPublisher#publish`, perform some transformations,
and finally dispatch events over the network and into Mantis.

Events are transformed by an `EventProcessor` which processes events one at a time.
Transformation includes the following steps:

1. Masks sensitive fields in the event.
    - Sensitive fields are referenced by a blacklist defined by a configuration
      (`mantis.publish.blacklist`).
    - This blacklist is a comma-delimited string of keys you wish to blacklist in your event. The
      `param.password` key is included by default.
1. Evaluates the MQL query of each subscription and builds a list of matching subscriptions.
1. For each matching subscription, enriches the event with a superset of fields from the MQL query
   from all the other matching subscriptions (see the following diagram).
1. Sends this enriched event to all of the subscribers (see
   [Event Delivery](#phase-3-event-delivery) below for the details).

!!! note
    More Mantis Publish configuration options can be found [here](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-publish/blob/d69d549335cd74149395e9a48780dd702bbc1b82/mantis-publish-core/src/main/java/io/mantisrx/publish/config/MrePublishConfiguration.java).

![RequestEventProcessor includes all RequestEvent fields requested by any subscriber in the results it gives to all subscribers](/images/RequestEventProcessor.svg)

### Phase 3: Event Delivery

Mantis Publish delivers events on-demand. When a client subscribes to a Mantis Job that issues an MQL query,
the Event Publisher delivers the event using non-blocking I/O.
