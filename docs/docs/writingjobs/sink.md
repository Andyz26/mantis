The [Sink]  [component] of a [Mantis Job] serves two purposes:

1. **Trigger job execution when a client subscribes to a Job**

    [RxJava]  [cold Observables] have a lazy execution model. Execution begins only when someone
    subscribes to the Observable. A Mantis Job is a complex Observable chain, and to trigger the
    execution of such a Job, somebody needs to subscribe to it. This happens in the Sink component.

1. **Output the results of job execution in a streaming fashion**

    Once you are done processing the input stream in the [Processing Stage] component, you need to
    figure out what to do with the results. Most jobs that write to some other system do so within
    the Processing Stage component itself (in such a case, the Sink component is usually used for
    debugging purposes).

To create a Sink component, you implement the `Sink` interface:

```java hl_lines="6"
import io.mantisrx.runtime.Context;
import io.mantisrx.runtime.PortRequest;
import rx.Observable;
import rx.functions.Action3;

public interface Sink<T> extends Action3<Context, PortRequest, Observable<T>> { }
```

## Built-in Sinks

Some Sinks are provided by Mantis. To get access to these Sinks, add this line to your source:

```java
import io.mantisrx.runtime.sink.Sinks;
```

### SSE Sink

The [SSE] Sink is commonly used. It makes the results of your Stage transformation available in the
form of an SSE stream.

To get an SSE Sink, pass an encoder function to the `sse()` method that accepts the data to be
streamed as input and outputs data encoded as needed. The following example attaches a sink to a
Mantis Job that passes the data from the last Processing Stage of the job, unchanged, to the SSE
stream:

```java
return MantisJob. … .sink(Sinks.sse((String data) -> data)). … .create();
```

### sysout Sink

The `sysout` Sink simply outputs the results from the previous Processing Stage directly to sysout.
For example:

```java
return MantisJob. … .sink(Sinks.sysout()). … .create();
```

### eagerSubscribe Sink

A typical Sink subscribes to the output of the previous Processing Stage at some point during the
call to its `call()` method. You may want some of your Mantis Jobs to start executing as soon as you
launch them. These include Jobs that run perpetually and power things like alerts, dashboards, and
so forth.

You can modify a Sink with `eagerSubscribe()` to create a Sink that that instead subscribes to the
output of the previous Processing Stage *immediately* when its `call()` method is called, even if it
has more processing to do within that method before it can respond to the output. This will start
your Mantis Job more quickly, but may mean some of its initial data is dropped.

For example:

```java
return MantisJob. … .sink(Sinks.eagerSubscribe(Sinks.sse((String data) -> data))). … .create();
```

Here is a more complete example:

```java
return MantisJob        
        // Reuse existing class that does all the plumbing of connecting to source jobs
        .source(new JobSource())

        // Groups requests by ESN
        .stage(new GroupByStage(), GroupByStage.config())

        // Computes sum over a window
        .stage(new FastAggregateStage(), FastAggregateStage.config())

        // Collects the data and makes it availabe over SSE
        .stage(new CollectStage(), CollectStage.config())

        // Reuse built in sink that eagerly subscribes and delivers data over SSE
        .sink(Sinks.eagerSubscribe(
                Sinks.sse((String data) -> data)
             ))

            // Here we define the job parameter overrides        

            // The query sent to the source job.
            // Here we fetch the esn for all requests hitting the source
            .parameterDefinition(new StringParameter()
            .name(MantisSourceJobConnector.MANTIS_SOURCEJOB_CRITERION)
            .validator(Validators.notNullOrEmpty())
            .defaultValue("SELECT customer_id, client_ip WHERE true")
            .build())    
                         
        .metadata(new Metadata.Builder()
            .name("GroupByIp")
            .description("Connects to a source job and counts the number of requests sent from each ip within a window")
            .build())
        .create();
```

### toMany Sink

You can hook up multiple Sinks to the same final Stage of a Job by using the `toMany` Sink. To do
this, pass each Sink to the `toMany()` method. For example:

```java
return MantisJob. … .sink(Sinks.toMany(Sinks.sysout(), Sinks.sse((String data) -> data))). … .create();
```

## Custom Sinks

If you do not want to use one of the provided Sinks, or if you need to customize one of those (for
instance, if you need access to the query parameters supplied by a client who is connecting into
your Job, or if you need pre and post hooks to perform operations as a new client connects or
disconnects), you can create your own Sink. To do so, implement the `Sink` interface.

The `ServerSentEventsSink` builder takes three parameters:

1. **Preprocess function**

    this callback gives you access to the query parameters; it is invoked before job execution
    begins

1. **Postprocess function**

    this callback allows you to perform any clean-up actions; it is invoked just after the client
    connection is terminated

1. **Predicate function**

    allows you to filter your output stream based on the given predicate, which allows you to filter
    based on query parameters sent by the client

Here is an example of a custom Sink that uses the `ServerSentEventsSink` builder:

```java
package com.netflix.mantis.sourcejob;

import io.mantisrx.runtime.Context;
import io.mantisrx.runtime.PortRequest;

    @Override

    }
  }

  public SourceSink() {
  }

  public SourceSink(Func2<Map<String,List<String>>,Context,Void> preProcessor,
           Func2<Map<String,List<String>>,Context,Void> postProcessor,
           String mantisClientId) {
    this.postProcessor = postProcessor;
    this.preProcessor = preProcessor;
    this.clientId = mantisClientId;
  }

  @Override
  public void call(Context context, PortRequest portRequest,
                   Observable<String> observable) {

    observable = observable.filter(new Func1<String,Boolean>() {
      @Override
      public Boolean call(String t1) {
        return !t1.isEmpty();
      }
    });

    ServerSentEventsSink<String> sink = new ServerSentEventsSink.Builder<String>()
    .withEncoder(new Func1<String, String>() {
      @Override
      public String call(String data) {
        return data;
      }
    })
    .withPredicate(new Predicate<String>("description",new EventFilter(clientId)))
    .withRequestPreprocessor(preProcessor)
    .withRequestPostprocessor(postProcessor)
    .build();

    observable.subscribe();

    sink.call(context, portRequest, observable);
  }

    byte [] barr = s.getBytes(Charsets.UTF_8);
    System.out.println("size: " + barr.length);
  }
